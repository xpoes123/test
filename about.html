            <h2>About the Conference</h2>
            <p>Our conference is aimed towards juniors and seniors both in and outside of the tech field looking to learn about current and upcoming theories, practices, and discourse around DEI work. We have some exciting talks scheduled to learn more about DEI work in the tech field and network with each other. Here is a link to the <a href="schedule.html">schedule</a>. View our <a href="policies.html">policies and Code of Conduct</a> to ensure we have a fun and inclusive event!</p>
            <p>Here is a map of Memorial Union. Please note: the venue is wheelchair accessible with ramp or elevator access and accessible restrooms. For the conference, we will be installing audio induction loops, tactile signs, and handrails for attendees with hearing or visual impairments. There will be proper signage that is easy to see and in multiple places.</p>
            <p>We will be training staff and volunteers on disability etiquette and accessibility best practices to ensure that attendees are provided with appropriate support and accommodations.
